# SneakWise - For Sneaker Lovers 

The overall goal of my software application is to create a tourist website for a hobbyist within a chosen city; leveraging gaps within an area of enjoyment, gaps that could be filled to increase accessibility within a certain city. I decided this was a great opportunity to create a central hub for sneaker lovers within the city of London; I have named the application ‘SneakWise’.

I quickly chose London as the city I would cater for specifically for the elevated love and dedication to sneaker collecting within London. Personal familiarisation highlights the residing sneaker community within London, their engagement and the many gaps in the community that could be filled within a software bringing the community together at a tighter knit. 
 
The sneaker culture in London has remained alive since discovering it as a child, the dedication within the community, paired with a useful online hub allowing for interaction with others, a virtual (mirroring) shoe collection and expression of opinions (along with many other elements).

Hope you enjoy it!
